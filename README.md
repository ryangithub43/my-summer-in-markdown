# My Summer in Markdown
# Introduction
My name is Ryan and this is my first project on Markdown. 
# Expectations
From this class, I can expect more understanding of computers, coding, and what it does for us. Since I took the recquired class before this one, I can say I know a little bit about computers. I also expect a good score on my AP Exam. 
# Goals
Throughout this entire school year, my goal is to just pass my classes. Countless amounts of people have said that Junior year is going to be the hardest out of the 4 years in high school, and for that reason, I also want to find out the best way to navigate through. 
# Summer Playlist
My playlists consists of many things: 
- The Weeknd
- Kanye West
- Playboi Carti
- Kendrick Lamar
There are many more, but this is my list of "Most Listened to Artist" in Spotify. 
# Favorite Summer Food
Summer is a time of enjoyment, but that also brings in 100 degree weather. The best way to combat this is to enjoy some cold ice cream. It's relatively cheap, it's easy to eat and prepare, and it's perfect for the summer heat. That's why it's my favorite.
